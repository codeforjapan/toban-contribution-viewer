# User Scenario: Slack Contribution Analysis

This scenario describes the end-to-end process for analyzing team contributions in Slack channels.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Toban Contribution Viewer for Slack analysis, the user must:

1. Have administrative access to a Slack workspace
2. Have an account on the Toban Contribution Viewer platform
3. Have authorized the Toban application with appropriate Slack permissions

## Scenario Flow

### 1. Workspace Connection

**User:** Mika, a team lead at a software company

**Goal:** Analyze team contributions in development and project channels to recognize hidden contributors

**Steps:**

1. Mika logs into the Toban Contribution Viewer platform
2. On the dashboard, Mika clicks the "Connect Workspace" button in the Slack integration section
3. The system redirects to Slack's OAuth authorization page
4. Mika reviews the requested permissions and authorizes the integration
5. Slack redirects back to Toban with an authorization code
6. The system exchanges the code for access tokens and stores them securely
7. The dashboard shows "Connected to Acme Corp Workspace" with the workspace icon

**System Actions:**
- Securely store Slack access tokens linked to Mika's account
- Verify token validity and permissions
- Retrieve basic workspace information (name, icon, team size)

### 2. Channel Selection

**Steps:**

1. After connecting, the system displays a list of all accessible channels
2. Mika selects specific channels for analysis:
   - #team-backend
   - #team-frontend
   - #project-redesign
   - #general
3. The system shows which channels already have the Toban bot installed and which don't
4. Mika clicks "Save Selection" to confirm the channels for analysis
5. If any selected channels don't have the bot installed, the system offers to automatically install the bot in those channels
6. Mika confirms the automatic installation

**System Actions:**
- For channels where the bot is not yet a member, automatically install the bot
- Report success/failure of bot installation to the user
- Check read permissions for historical messages
- Save channel selection preferences to Mika's account

### 3. Analysis Configuration

**Steps:**

1. Mika navigates to "New Analysis" in the dashboard
2. Selects "Slack Contribution Analysis" as the analysis type
3. Configures analysis parameters:
   - **Time Period**: Last 30 days (March 5 - April 5, 2025)
   - **Channels**: Uses the previously selected channels
   - **Analysis Depth**: Comprehensive (includes messages, threads, reactions)
   - **Focus Areas**: Problem-solving, Knowledge sharing, Team coordination
4. Optionally adds context about recent projects or team goals
5. Clicks "Start Analysis" to begin the process

**System Actions:**
- Validate that the selected time period is within available data range
- Estimate processing time based on channel activity volume
- Create an analysis job with a unique identifier

### 4. Data Retrieval and Processing

**System Actions (background):**

1. For each selected channel, the system:
   - Retrieves all messages within the specified time period
   - Collects threaded replies and reactions
   - Retrieves user profile information for context
   - Stores raw data in temporary storage

2. Processes the retrieved data:
   - Cleans and normalizes message formats
   - Resolves user and channel references
   - Reconstructs conversation threads
   - Prepares data for AI analysis

3. Updates the analysis status in real-time:
   - "Retrieved 1,245 messages from #team-backend"
   - "Processing conversation threads in #project-redesign"

### 5. AI Analysis

**System Actions (background):**

1. For each channles, the AI analyzes:
   - What kind of topics have been discussed and what decisions were made.
   - What kind of achievement have done by whom.
   - Top tier coordination and facilitation activities.

2. For each team member, the AI evaluates:
   - Problem-solving contributions
   - Knowledge sharing value
   - Team coordination efforts
   - Response patterns and helpfulness
   - Cross-topic engagement

3. Generates contribution scores with explanations:
   - Numerical scores for different contribution types
   - Qualitative analysis of contribution patterns
   - Identification of notable contributions
   - Team dynamics insights

### 6. Results Review

**Steps:**

1. Mika receives a notification that the analysis is complete
2. Navigates to the "Analysis Results" page
3. Views the comprehensive dashboard showing:
   - Overall team contribution breakdown
   - Individual contribution scores by category
   - Notable contributions highlighted with context
   - Channel-specific insights and patterns

4. Explores individual team member profiles:
   - Selects Alex's profile to see detailed contribution analysis
   - Notes that while Alex sends fewer messages than others, they have high problem-solving scores
   - Reviews specific examples of valuable contributions

5. Compares contribution patterns across channels:
   - Notes that Dana is highly active in knowledge sharing in #team-backend
   - Observes that Sam excels at team coordination in #project-redesign

6. Reviews AI-generated insights:
   - Key knowledge sharers identified
   - Hidden problem-solvers recognized
   - Team coordination patterns revealed
   - Areas where additional support might be needed

### 7. Sharing and Action

**Steps:**

1. Mika creates a shareable report with selected insights:
   - Customizes which metrics to include
   - Adds personal notes and context
   - Selects appropriate level of detail

2. Shares the report with:
   - Team members for transparency and recognition
   - Management for performance reviews
   - Project stakeholders for team health updates

3. Uses insights to inform team development:
   - Recognizes hidden contributors in team meetings
   - Pairs team members based on complementary skills
   - Identifies knowledge sharing opportunities
   - Plans targeted team building activities

4. Schedules recurring analyses for ongoing tracking

## Benefits

1. **Recognition of Hidden Contributors:**
   - Team members who provide quality rather than quantity are recognized
   - Subject matter experts are identified across different topics
   - Supportive team members who facilitate others' work get visibility

2. **Data-Driven Team Management:**
   - Objective metrics supplement subjective impressions
   - Contribution patterns reveal team dynamics
   - Progress can be tracked over time

3. **Improved Team Development:**
   - Clear picture of team strengths and growth areas
   - Recognition increases motivation and engagement
   - Knowledge sharing patterns can be optimized

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Slack API rate limits must be carefully managed during data retrieval
- Message content must be processed in batches for efficient AI analysis
- User identification must be consistent across messages and reactions
- Time zone handling is critical for accurate period selection
- Privacy considerations must be addressed with appropriate data handling
- Results should be cached for efficient retrieval and sharing
